# Sunspots_ML
ðŸ“– Overview
This project analyzes a comprehensive historical dataset of daily sunspot observations and develops a machine learning model to predict sunspot activity. Sunspots are a critical metric for measuring solar activity, which influences space weather and can affect satellite operations, power grids, and communication systems on Earth.

The workflow involves a thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and correlations, followed by feature engineering and the training of a Random Forest Regressor to accurately predict sunspot numbers.
